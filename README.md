# CUSTOM GAME ENGINES

A comprehensive list of custom game engines. This list is based on a 2020 article: [custom_game_engines_small_study](https://gist.github.com/raysan5/909dc6cf33ed40223eb0dfe625c0de74)

The list has been moved to a custom repo to allow contributors to improve it! **Additions and improvements are really welcome!!!**

## Introduction

Nowadays lots of companies choose engines like [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) or [Unity](https://unity.com) for their games (or that's what lot of people think) because developing a custom AAA-level engine requires lots of resources, still, there are many big/small companies or even individuals that choose to create their custom engines for their games. In this page there are some of those engines listed.

Some points to consider:

 - The line between what can be considered an engine or a framework or just a library could be blurry. Note that not all engines have a set of tooling for easy interaction!
 - Most of the engines listed here have been developed along the years with multiple iterations and multiple videogames, those engines have gone through several versions or even complete (or semi-complete) rewrites from scratch, with a consequent engine name change. Also, important to note, most of those engines use numerous middleware for specific functionalities (Platform, Physics, Network, Vegetation, UI, Rendering, Audio...).
 - About the employees count, take it with a grain of salt, it was updated with aproximate numbers from 2020 (checked on the companies websites, Wikipedia or LinkedIn).


## AAA Engines: The BIG Companies

Below list is for **very big corporations**, sometimes with complex corporate structures with several divisions (not only focused on videogames) and various studios/subsidiaries developing games. Some of those companies work with multiple engines, not only custom ones but also licensed ones.

## AA Engines: Small-size Studios (Indie Studios)

Here we have some really small studios that also choose to develop a custom engine for their games. Note that most of those engines rely on other libraries/frameworks for certain parts of the game, the common choices we find are [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org) (cross-platform graphics/input), [OGRE](https://www.ogre3d.org) (rendering engine), [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net) (cross-platform game framework, also relies on [SDL, SharpDX, OpenTK, OpenAL-Soft...](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame.Dependencies)).
